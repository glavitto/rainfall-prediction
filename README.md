# 🌧️ Predicting Rainfall in Australia with XGBoost
As a passionate data scientist, I’ve developed a machine learning model that predicts rainfall in various regions of Australia. Leveraging the “Rain in Australia” dataset from Kaggle, I achieved an impressive 85% accuracy using XGBoost.
📊 Project Overview:
Data Source: The dataset contains daily weather observations sourced from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
Business Problem: Accurate rain forecasts impact everything from agriculture to travel planning. My goal was to create a next-day prediction model for rain.
Best Model: The XGBoost model performed exceptionally well, achieving an 86% accuracy.
